#Project Documentation

This article is a collaborative project by students from the  University of the Philippines Open University under the BA Multimedia  Arts Program. The group saw the huge impact of streaming in both  technology and business. This has led them to research and publish this  article about streaming services and how it has disrupted our world  today.

##Streaming and How it Revolutionized the TV, Music, and Movie Industries
It may be fitting to sing the song ["Video Killed the Radio Star"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrjdpNDfZLo)  to describe the triumph of streaming services over traditional media (television, radio, and movies).  However, the disruption caused by it didn't killed everyone, but rather they joined it. Media on demand by way of streaming services has toppled media giants. This is evident on how they themselves have created streaming services of their own (examples are Disney+, Amazon, HBO). The 'on-demand' business model for media is not new. We can see this on VHS and cassette tape rentals. But the advent of Internet and the Web has put this model to another level. Today, millions of movies, and music are available for "rent" or "on-demand" 24/7.
