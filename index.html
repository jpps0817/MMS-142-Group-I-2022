                                <h3>Disruptive Technologies: An Introduction</h3>
                                <p>Disruptive technology or innovation occurs when a business creates products or services that offer better, cheaper, and commercially sustainable solutions catering to the needs of its consumers. Its usually small then it gradually expands as more and more users discover its benefits. This situation is led and facilitated  by the gamechangers, formally known as the "disruptors."</p>
                                <p>While there is no fixed definition of disruptive technologies, the concept remains a relevant topic of discourse especially with the launch of new internet technologies. As the internet becomes more powerful and practically omnipresent, disruptive technologies are given an enormous boost!
                                For the disruptors, it's critical to find opportunities in existing technology where the demands of the consumers aren't being met. The goal is to lower cost, to promote brand loyalty, to respond to opportunities based on customer demand, and to fully take advantage of what technology can offer.
                                Disruptive technology or innovation has resulted in game-changing solutions in various industries and markets such as hospitality, transportation, medical, engineering, and entertainment.</p>

                                <h3>Description on Disruptive Technologies</h3>
                                <p>Disruptive Technology is when the expensive products are being transformed to or created by small businesses as products that are accessible and affordable to the market. The concept of this is different from improving a product since it focuses on how easy it is to use the product and its accessibility to the market, even non-targeted market (Twin, 2022). 
                                </p>
                                <p>Disruption occurs when a small business enters a market and offers low-cost products and services. Customers of incumbents or large businesses gradually adopt the cheaper products and services offered by the entrants as their offerings improve. </p>
                                <p>There are two types of Disruptive Technology. The first type of disruption is Low-End disruption, which refers to small businesses that enter the bottom of the market and offer less expensive products (Cote, 2020). The second type is New-Market disruption, which is when a business offers cheaper alternative products targeting a market that doesn’t exist yet (Cote, 2020). 
                                </p>

                                <h3>Steaming as an Example of Discruption Technology</h3>
                                <p>Streaming is a term coined to describe any media content whether it be live or recorded, played back in real time and delivered to any smart device through the use of the internet. Various media like movies, television shows, podcasts, and music videos are among the popular forms of streaming content. 
                                </p>
                                <h4>How does streaming work?</h4>
                                <p>It is practically easy to stream, all you need is a compatible device(smartphone, tablet, laptops etc.), a subscription to the particular streaming service you would like to partake in, and of course a fast and reliable internet connection. After satisfying these conditions, you will be able to stream an array of Music, video, and other types of media files(depending on the streaming service), which are pre-arranged and shown as a collection of data that can be accessed instantaneously. The main difference between streaming and downloading media files is that unlike traditional downloads, streamed media files are deleted or removed once you play them. 
                                </p>

                                <h3>Why and how is it Disruptive?</h3>
                                <p>Streaming improves the way media is shared and brought out to consumers, but being a disruptive technology it completely adds a new industry for media, different from just improvement and innovation.

                                <h3>About Music Streaming</h3>
                                <p>Music streaming or audio streaming is a method of delivering real-time audio through network connection (Techopedia, n.d.). It means that an individual can listen to music without downloading a file. Streaming allows a ton of music available without storing or buying individual songs/albums. Music streaming services such as Spotify provide users with access to an online database which consists of songs, albums, podcasts, and playlists that can be downloaded, shared, and listened to anywhere. While this type of streaming platform allows independent artists and small labels to distribute music on a level playing field, artists often struggle with the financial side of the business. Analysts believed that Spotify had disrupted the music industry's traditional business structures in a similar way to Napster, except that they made it legally. It also received heavy criticism due to its freemium model.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Music Streaming and Its Business Model</h3>
                                <p>An artist or label's music can be channeled to a wider audience using digital sponsorship. With the amount of income and revenue generated in subscriptions, artists boost the market by feeding their subscribers or users with online music they can listen to.
                            </p>
                                <p>Once royalty payments are made with an artist's album, the digital version gets released to the public according to their record label contract.
                                </p>
                                <p>A typical label contract would see an artist receive 10 to 20 percent of revenue for physical sales, or around $1.50-3.00 for each sale of a $15 CD (Heanue, 2022). 
                                </p>
                                <p>However they were signs that artists or creators struggle to pay rent as soon as they have listeners on the go. Research shows that 82% of artists on streaming platforms earn less than $270 per year (King, 2020). It would take around 229 streams until an artist's album or record gains traction.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Video Streaming and Why it is Disruptive</h3>
                                <p>Video streaming established a new era of media consumption, with streaming services leading content distribution from a variety of genres in both television and film. Before this, media viewing for these types of content relied on movie theaters, Blu-Ray discs, DVD and DVD rentals, cable television, live viewing, and `	buying video-on-demand. 
                                </p>
                                <p>The pandemic saw a spike in subscriptions and stream time brought upon by lockdown restrictions, with subscriptions passing over 1 billion worldwide in 2020 (Faughnder, 2021). In contrast to the rise of online video streaming apps, cinema theaters lamentably depleted film revenues that have been predicted to lose $5 billion as a result of the pandemic (Metcalf, 2022).
                                </p>
                                <p>Straight-to-stream films have become more common, shorter theatrical releases, with more demand to watch media at home on their own time (Pennington, 2022). Most shows and films to date are distributed online via SVOD (Subscription Video On Demand) apps like Netflix, HBO, Viu, Disney+, etc.  But, with more streaming services rising, some see such services reaching a plateau, and what is to come within this era of streaming needs another innovative disruption.
                                </p>
                                <p>Netflix led the radical change in the video streaming industry by offering users premium content through a subscription model. Its disruption of the industry in 2007 introduced its pivot from its DVD subscription mail service by offering limited shows and films to stream on the Internet, which slowly adopted a more mainstream audience (Danesi, 2021; Kasper, 2022). By 2013, the disruption brought by Netflix developed further once it produced and released original content on the streaming platform. 
                                </p>
                                <p>For nations like the Philippines, streaming longer content like films and TV is still on a slow climb due to the costly nature of Internet subscriptions and the additional expense of paying for subscription services. Because of the incapacity to afford to watch in cinemas or subscribe to content service providers like Netflix, nearly half of the Filipino population admitted to downloading torrents and watching online movies or shows on illegal streaming sites, despite knowing the risks of piracy (Balinbin, 2020). Moreover, the free access to short-form digital video contents has made Filipinos occupy the top rank for the most active users in Youtube and Tiktok with a growing number of digital content creators from the Philippines as more Filipino audience transitioned from free-to-air streaming to online streaming (Truelogic Marketing, 2020).
                                </p>
                                <p>Not only does video streaming disrupt the stream of content available, but changed how people consume media content through the introduction of binge-watching and the shortening of the viewers’ attention span - preferring to watch short-forms over long-form videos, and preferring to watch at home than in theaters. In introducing the diversification of content and democratizing its consumption, it abandoned the once consistent and formulaic approach of network and cable television programming. Tailored content enabled more diverse representation on-screen for underserved audiences (Alcorn, 2021). Furthermore, the presence of illegal streaming sites causing the continual thriving of piracy, and illegal file-sharing or distribution of films or digital content affects the revenue of films which threatens the media and entertainment industry.

                                <p>Given our generation's money, time, and resources we have, as well as the way advancing technology continues dominating our world, people are becoming more acquainted with having everything they desire within reach of their smartphones. With one click, everything is now possible. From watching films in theaters to watching them via subscription, and from purchasing physical albums to streaming music to various online platforms. This type of disruption leads to such downfall of traditional businesses. However, keep in mind that Spotify, Netflix, and other streaming platforms are succeeding due to a widespread shift in trends and businesses toward the new way of life. Thus, despite such disruptive technologies, traditional businesses can learn to thrive in the business industry by placing their platforms through streaming and catering to streamers' needs.
